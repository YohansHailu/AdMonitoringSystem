# AdMonitoringSystem
Advertisement is a process of promoting a product and service in different media of communication. His project discusses how to efficiently control the release of advertisements on live streaming tv channels . That is we try to count the number of times the advertisement is being released and at what specific time the advertisement is being released . This can be achieved by using the patterns in the advertisement videos and the image in it so we have to recognise the pattern and analyse the images in the advertisement videos by using pattern recognition,image processing and  AI deep learning .
