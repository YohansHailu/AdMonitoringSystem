# Live Streaming Advertisements Montoring System

This project aims to develop a system that can efficiently monitor and register the release of advertisements on live streaming TV channels. The system will be able to count the number of times a given advertisement is being released and at what specific time the advertisement is being released. This can be achieved by using the patterns in the advertisement videos and the image in it so we have to recognize the pattern and analyze the images in the advertisement videos by using pattern recognition, image processing, and AI deep learning.
